</p>
<p>
  2) EMIT_L2A_RFL_001_20230119T114235_2301907_004_ch_100-1.jpg  
</p>

### RLJLW-Challenge-2023.pptx

<p>
RLJLW-Challenge-2023.pptx is a power point demonstration that shows some of the features of the Space Apps Challenge Project, and what was created.
</p>
<p>
The images described in this powerpoint were created from data in NASA EMIT FILE EMIT_L2A_RFL_001_20230119T114235_2301907_004.nc, which was then processed using tools writting
by the developer in Python.
</p>

### EMIT_L2A_RFL_001_20230119T114235_2301907_004_ch_100-1.jpg

<p>
Is cropped portion of a fully processed NASA EMIT data image created while working on the project using an ASP.NET image processing tool created by this developer.
</p>
<p>
A 1.8GB data file was downloaded from NASA, EMIT_L2A_RFL_001_20230119T114235_2301907_004.nc.
</p>
<p>
A C# ASP.NET tool was created to process the data file, to show band 100, which is an infrared band.
</p>
The image reflectance intensity was then mapped to a full 1242 x 1280 grey scale BMP image.
</p>
<p>
The image was then cropped and converted to a JPG file showing a portion of the image.
