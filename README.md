### EMIT_L2A_RFL_001_20230119T114235_2301907_004_ch_100-1.jpg

Is cropped portion of a fully processed NASA EMIT data image created while working on the project using an ASP.NET image processing tool created by this developer.
A 1.8GB data file was downloaded from NASA, EMIT_L2A_RFL_001_20230119T114235_2301907_004.nc.
A C# ASP.NET Tool was created to process the data file, to show band 100, which is an infrared band.
The image reflectance intensity was then mapped to a full 1242 x 1280 grey scale BMP image.
The image was then cropped and converted to a JPG file showing a portion of the image.
